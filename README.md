Bolt Chmodinator
================

Welcome to the <strong>Chmodinator</strong>!

If you're having issues with your Bolt files not being removable using your FTP
client or vice-versa, this extension will help you sort it out by applying
'chmod' to set the correct permissions to it. Clicking the 'Fix' button will try
to make all files in the data folders writable to 'all', and it will inform you
of any files it couldn't modify, so you can change them using the command line
or your (S)FTP client.

After installation, you can find the Chmodinator under 'Extensions' > 'Chmodinator'.

You should be aware that using this tool is not considered 'good practice'. If
possible, you should work with your system administrator to get things set up
properly. If that's not an option, or if you're on shared hosting, this
extension will help you out!
